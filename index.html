            Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But

          <p>
            We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving
            force behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people
            we make it for.

          <p>
            Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us

            and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are
            self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects
            us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge
            to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
            culture.

            richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set
            of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion
            and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

            Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively
            supported in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on
            applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized
            development and music salons are a chance to discuss new
            technologies, production techniques and best practices.

            If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and
            paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free German or English
            lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive
            health insurance for you and your family, as well as generous
            maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s
            not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout
            the year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group
            activities.
